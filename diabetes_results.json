        "abstract": "Population mean levels of total cholesterol and fasting triglycerides have decreased substantially in the US in recent decades, but improvements in cardiometabolic health may have slowed among younger cohorts. Conversely, prevalence of diabetes (types 1 and 2) and obesity has increased, especially among adults younger than 65 years. It is unclear how trends in cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels have changed across different birth cohorts and whether adverse trends in obesity are associated with these patterns."
