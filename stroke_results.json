        "title": "New alternative approaches to stroke treatment: the blood cell-derived secretome shows promise in individuals with obesity.",
        "abstract": "Ischaemic tolerance induced by remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been extensively demonstrated in several preclinical models of cerebral ischaemia. However, animals with common stroke-related comorbidities do not benefit from the recent advances of RIC. Therefore, we investigated two alternative approaches for obese animals with stroke: (1) the efficacy of an additional round of the standard RIC protocol, and (2) the paracrine potential of the blood cell-derived secretome derived from RIC-induced healthy young rats. We found that a second round of remote ischaemic postconditioning (RIPostC) stimulus reduced neurodegeneration and exerted antioxidant effects but failed to decrease the infarct volume and alter glutamate homeostasis. However, when obese rats were administered the secretome from healthy, young RIC-stimulated rats, they exhibited improved neurological post-stroke outcomes. Intravenous administration of the tolerant secretome activated several endogenous mechanisms, including a reduction in the infarct volume and neurodegeneration in the penumbra. Furthermore, the blood cell-derived secretome accelerated brain-to-blood glutamate efflux in obese rats, and demonstrated antioxidant properties that may have contributed to the induction of tolerance in obese rats with stroke. These findings indicate that the blood cell-derived secretome has unique abilities and represents a new potential treatment for individuals with obesity and ischaemic stroke."

        "title": "Trends in antithrombotic therapy and clinical outcomes for percutaneous coronary intervention in Japan following the 2020 JCS guideline focused update: findings from the SAKURA PCI2 Antithrombotic Registry.",
        "abstract": "In April 2020, the Japanese Circulation Society updated guidelines recommending shortened dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for patients at Japanese Version of the High Bleeding Risk (J-HBR), but the impact remains unclear. We conducted a prospective multicenter registry (SAKURA PCI2 Antithrombotic Registry) starting June 2020 (n\u2009=\u20091136), enrolling patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Planned DAPT duration, defined as short if less than 3\u00a0months, was based on patient background post-PCI and physicians' discretion. Planned short DAPT was used in 55.2% of patients, with a similar incidence of J-HBR (68.3% vs. 66.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.55) and a shorter actual DAPT duration (97 vs. 229\u00a0days, p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared with Planned non-short DAPT. Primary endpoints, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) including all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and stroke, and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3 or 5 bleeding (BARC-3/5), occurred similarly across groups (MACCE: 6.5% vs. 7.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.66; BARC-3/5: 3.7% vs. 2.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.14). Independent predictors of MACCE included age\u2009\u2265\u200975, Clinical Frailty Scale\u2009\u2265\u20094, and hemoglobin\u2009<\u200911. Age\u2009\u2265\u200975, severe chronic kidney disease, hemoglobin\u2009<\u200911, and platelets\u2009<\u2009100,000 were linked to BARC-3/5. Among BARC 3/5 patients, 41.2% experienced bleeding after switching to single antiplatelet therapy. Planned short DAPT was implemented in 55.2% of patients, showing comparable thrombotic and bleeding outcomes to non-short DAPT."
